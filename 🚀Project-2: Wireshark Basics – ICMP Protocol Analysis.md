# üöÄProject-2: Wireshark Basics ‚Äì ICMP Protocol Analysis

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this lab is to help, understand and analyse ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets using Wireshark. will learn to identify echo requests/replies, interpret ICMP packet fields, and apply relevant filters for investigation.


## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
- Software: Wireshark (latest version)

### Files Needed
- ICMP is a Layer 3 protocol used for sending error messages and operational information. The most common ICMP messages include Echo Request (Type 8) and Echo Reply (Type 0).

### Key ICMP Fields:
- Field Name	Description
- Type	Defines the ICMP message type
- Code	Provides further detail for the type
- Checksum	Error-checking for header
- Identifier	Helps match requests and replies
- Sequence No.	Sequence of the request/reply
- Data	Optional payload

## üîç Most Common ICMP Display Filters
### Use these filters in Wireshark‚Äôs Display Filter bar:
### Filter	Description
- icmp	Show all ICMP traffic
- icmp.type == 8	Show Echo Requests (ping)
- icmp.type == 0	Show Echo Replies
- icmp.code == 3	Destination unreachable
- ip.addr == 192.168.1.10	ICMP traffic from/to specific host


## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- ICMP is a fundamental protocol for network troubleshooting.
- Wireshark helps visualise ICMP packet flow and structure.
- Understanding ICMP helps detect network scanning, ping sweeps, and unreachable hosts.

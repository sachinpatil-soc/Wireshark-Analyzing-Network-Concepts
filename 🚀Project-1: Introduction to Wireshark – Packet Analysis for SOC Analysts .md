# 🚀Project-1: Introduction to Wireshark – Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce about Wireshark, a powerful packet analysis tool used by SOC analysts to investigate network traffic. will learn the interface, how to capture packets, apply filters, and identify suspicious communication patterns.



## 🛠️ Lab Setup

## System Requirements

Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
Network Adapter: Required for packet capture
Software Required

Wireshark (latest stable version)
Download Sample PCAP file

## 📘 What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyser that lets you capture and interactively browse network traffic. It allows analysts to view data packets flowing in and out of a system in real time or from saved PCAP files.

### 🛡️ Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts

**Incident Investigation:**

* **Malicious Traffic Analysis:** Examine suspicious traffic patterns, including C2 communication and lateral movement.
* **Malware Analysis:** Extract indicators such as domains, IP addresses, and payloads from anomalous network behaviour.
* **Threat Hunting:** Identify anomalies, including DNS tunnelling, beaconing, and unauthorised FTP/SSH usage.
* **Protocol Troubleshooting:** Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues.

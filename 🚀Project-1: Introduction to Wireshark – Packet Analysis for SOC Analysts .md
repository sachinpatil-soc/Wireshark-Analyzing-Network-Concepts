# 🚀Project-1: Introduction to Wireshark – Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts**

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The objective of this lab is to learn about **Wireshark**, a powerful packet analysis tool used by SOC analysts to investigate network traffic. Students will learn the interface, how to capture packets, apply filters, and identify suspicious communication patterns.


## 🛠️ **Lab Setup**

### **System Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **Network Adapter:** Required for packet capture

### **Software Required**
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (latest stable version)
- [Download Sample PCAP file](https://github.com/0xrajneesh/90-Days-SOC-Challenge-Beginner/raw/refs/heads/main/Protocol_Analysis_pcap.pcapng)

## 📘 **What is Wireshark?**

**Wireshark** is an open-source network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively browse network traffic. It allows analysts to view data packets flowing in and out of a system in real time or from saved PCAP files.

## 🛡️ **Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts**

- 🔍 **Incident Investigation:** Analyze malicious traffic patterns (e.g., C2 communication, lateral movement)
- 🕵️ **Malware Analysis:** Extract indicators like domains, IPs, and payloads from suspicious network behavior
- 🚨 **Threat Hunting:** Detect anomalies like DNS tunneling, beaconing, or unauthorized FTP/SSH usage
- 🛠️ **Protocol Troubleshooting:** Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues

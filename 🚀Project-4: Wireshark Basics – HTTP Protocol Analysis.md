# 🚀Project-4: Wireshark Basics – HTTP Protocol Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this lab is to analyse HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) packets using Wireshark. Will explore HTTP request/response headers, understand how web communication works, and learn how to detect common HTTP-based attacks or data leaks.


## 🛠️ Lab Setup
### System Requirements:
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
- Software: Wireshark (latest version)


### 📘 HTTP Packet Structure and Fields
- HTTP is an application-layer protocol used for communication between clients (browsers) and web servers. It typically runs over TCP port 80.

### Key HTTP Fields:

| Field Name	                                             | Description 
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Request Method	                                  |          GET, POST, HEAD, etc.|
|Host	                                            | The website being accessed|
|User-Agent                                       |   	Information about the client/browser|
|URI	                                            |     Resource path on the server|
|Status Code                                  	  |    Server's response status (e.g., 200 OK)|
|Content-Type                                	    |  MIME type of the response (e.g., text/html)|
|Cookie/Header                                    |   	Session or tracking information| 


## 🔍 Most Common HTTP Display Filters
#### Use these filters in Wireshark’s Display Filter bar:

| Filter	                                         |    Description 
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|http	                                             | Show all HTTP traffic
|tcp.port == 80	                                   | HTTP traffic by default port
|http.request.method == "GET"                      |	Show all GET requests
|http.request.uri	                                 | View requested resources
|http.set_cookie	                                 | Show cookies in HTTP responses
|ip.addr == 192.168.1.10                           |	HTTP traffic to/from specific host



## ✅ Conclusion
- HTTP traffic is readable and easy to analyze in Wireshark.
- Analyzing HTTP helps detect:
- Sensitive data exposure in URLs or headers
- Malware beaconing to C2 servers
- Suspicious file downloads or unauthorized access
